[Blackoin's Proof of Stake](https://giaki3003.tech/proof-of-stake-by-giaki3003-part-1?guid=none&deviceId=5e95d5fc-49b6-4f77-a387-1a2cb3627454)
> "In this overview of State-less/Epoch-less Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency implementations, my objective ideally is to divide PoS implementations in two big subgroups, this being the first one. In fact, while all Proof-of-Stake implementations try and achieve the shift of work to on-chain economic value, a radical difference comes to how their own block primitive is structured; a group of PoS implementations always requires a certain amount of "Proof-of-Stake-only bytes" in the block primitive header, which is not work related. Tracing a line here helps us identify such a broad set of different implementations."

> "Version n
>    The greater your economic commitment, the greater your chance at producing a valid block.
> A fork of "nil-n" PoS, Proof-of-Stake version-n was first implemented in Blackcoin, as described in the Blackcoin protocol whitepaper. "
