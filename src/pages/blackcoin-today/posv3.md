> Security Analysis of Proof-of-Stake Protocol v3.0 Blackcoin https://blackcoin.co/ 10/17/2016 AbstractProof of Stake's security has proven itself over years of testing. Advances in this technology in Blackcoin's Proof-of-Stake 3.0 have solved the issues faced with Coin-Age, Block Reward and Blockchain Precomputation. The protocol is robust and keeps nodes connected to the network. It disincentives inactive nodes. In this paper we will highlight and outline the advantages and perform a security analysis of the system. We also outline ideas here in Blackcoin to potentially increase security further.

> In every cryptocurrency there must be some consensus mechanism which keeps the entire distributed network in sync. When Bitcoin first came out, it introduced the Proof of Work (PoW) system. PoW is done by cryptographically hashing a piece of data (the block header) over and over. Because of how one-way hashing works. One tiny change in the data can cause an extremely different hash to come of it. Participants in the network determine if the PoW is valid complete by judging if the final hash meets a certain condition, called difficulty. The difficulty is an ever changing "target" which the hash must meet or exceed. Whenever the network is creating more blocks than scheduled, this target is changed automatically by the network so that the target becomes more and more difficult to meet. And thus, requires more and more computing power to find a hash that matches the target within the target time of 10 minutes.
